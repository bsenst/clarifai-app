# Llama-2 Reasoning Support

This is an experimental app as contribution to the [lablab.ai clarifai hackathon](https://lablab.ai/event/llama-2-hackathon-with-clarifai). The user enters a list of symptoms that are prompted via langchian to the open-source large language model llama-2-13b-chat hosted by clarifai. The app is publically hosted on streamlit cloud and can be found at [llama-reasoning-support.streamlit.app](https://llama-reasoning-support.streamlit.app/)

*This experimental app does not provide medical advice and is for testing purpose only. It does not replace clinical expertise.*
